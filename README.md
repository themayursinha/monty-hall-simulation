# Monty Hall Simulation Project

This project contains two main components:
1. A Python simulation of the Monty Hall problem to statistically demonstrate the outcomes of staying or switching doors.
2. A web-based interactive version of the Monty Hall game that allows users to play the game through a web interface.

## Python Simulation

### Overview
The Python part of this project simulates the Monty Hall problem, running numerous trials to show the probability of winning when staying with the initial choice versus switching to the other door.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x

### Running the Simulation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the simulation script with the command: `python3 monty_hall_simulation.py`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the number of trials or use the default settings.

## Web-based Interactive Game

### Overview
The web version allows users to interactively play the Monty Hall game, choosing doors and deciding whether to switch after one door is revealed.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Running the Game
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Play the game by clicking on doors and making your choices as prompted.

## Development Setup
For developers looking to work on the project, here's how to set up your environment:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed for the simulation part.
- Any standard web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) is sufficient to run the web game.
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text) for editing the project files.
